Box Office Analysis
An analysis to rank the greatest box office movie using revenue, consumer price 
index (CPI), and world population.

Summary
While the latest movies are constantly breaking box office records, does it 
really reflect the bigger picture of a best box office movie of all time? By 
standardizing revenue for box office movies with the average consumer price 
index (CPI), and scaling revenue by a per world population rate, we can get a 
better answer to the greatest box office movie of all time.

The answer: Star Wars (1977)*

*aka Star Wars IV: A New Hope. The original film was simply titled "Star Wars"

"Episode IV: A New Hope" to the crawl at the start of the movie and it's been 
named that ever since.
